# BejSnap - GitHub Publishing Summary

We've prepared everything needed to publish BejSnap to GitHub:

## Files Created for GitHub

1. **`.gitignore`** - Configured to exclude build files, IDE-specific files, and OS-specific files
2. **`.github/workflows/build.yml`** - GitHub Actions workflow for continuous integration
3. **`GITHUB_SETUP.md`** - Detailed step-by-step instructions for publishing to GitHub
4. **`github_publish.sh`** - Helper script to automate the Git initialization and setup process

## How to Publish

### Method 1: Using the Helper Script (Recommended)

1. Create a new repository on GitHub named "BejSnap" (don't initialize it with any files)
2. Run the helper script with your GitHub username:
   ```
   ./github_publish.sh your-github-username
   ```
3. Push to GitHub:
   ```
   git push -u origin main
   ```

### Method 2: Manual Process

Follow the detailed steps in `GITHUB_SETUP.md`.

## What Happens After Publishing

1. **GitHub Actions**: The CI workflow will automatically run on each push, verifying the build
2. **Contributors**: Others can now clone, fork, and contribute to your project
3. **Issues & PRs**: You can use GitHub's issue tracker and pull request system for collaboration
4. **Releases**: You can create tagged releases for stable versions

## Additional Features to Consider

- Add screenshots to your README.md to showcase the application
- Create a wiki for more detailed documentation
- Set up GitHub Pages for a project website
- Add badges to your README (build status, etc.)

Your BejSnap project is now ready to be shared with the world!
